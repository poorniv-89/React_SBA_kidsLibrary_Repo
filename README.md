**Description**
Kids Book Library is a fun app where kids can find and explore children’s books. They can search for books by title or topic and see colorful pictures of the books. 
This app uses the **Open Library API**, a free and open database of books. The API allows us to search for children’s books by title or subject, and it provides book details like titles, authors and cover images. This helps kids explore a wide variety of books easily without needing to visit multiple websites.

The Kids Book Library app includes several pages to make exploring books fun and easy:

**Home Page**: Features 10 random popular children’s books picked for the week, giving kids fresh recommendations every time they visit.

**Books Page**: Displays a gallery of children’s books matching the searched title or subject.

**Favorites Page**: Lets users save their favorite books for quick access later. **Stretch Goals**

**About Page**: Provides information about the Kids Book Library app — what it does, who it’s for and how it helps kids discover fun and educational books.
